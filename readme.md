## Recent fixes

- 2026-04-11: SliceMK validation failure caused by synced `&magic` bindings was resolved by adding a SliceMK-specific rewrite in sync logic (`&magic` → `&none`).
- RCA: [docs/rca-slicemk-magic-validation-failure-2026-04-11.md](docs/rca-slicemk-magic-validation-failure-2026-04-11.md)

### Layers (21 total)

| # | Name | File |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Base | `layers/base.dtsi` |
| 1 | Typing | `layers/typing.dtsi` |
| 2 | Autoshift | `layers/autoshift.dtsi` |
| 3–6 | HRM Left (Pinky/Ring/Middy/Index) | `layers/hrm_left_*.dtsi` |
| 7–10 | HRM Right (Pinky/Ring/Middy/Index) | `layers/hrm_right_*.dtsi` |
| 11 | Cursor | `layers/cursor.dtsi` |
| 12 | Keypad | `layers/keypad.dtsi` |
| 13 | Symbol | `layers/symbol.dtsi` |
| 14–17 | Mouse / MouseSlow / MouseFast / MouseWarp | `layers/mouse*.dtsi` |
| 18 | Magic | `layers/magic.dtsi` |
| 19 | Symbol_lh | `layers/symbol_lh.dtsi` |
| 20 | Symbol_rh | `layers/symbol_rh.dtsi` |

> SliceMK excludes shared magic includes (RGB_STATUS is unsupported in the `slicemk/zmk` fork), so it has 20 active layers.

### Key position naming

Positions use logical names so combos and HRM behaviors compile correctly across all boards:

- `POS_LH_CxRx` — left hand, column x, row x (1-indexed)
- `POS_RH_CxRx` — right hand, column x, row x
- `POS_LH_T1/T2/T3` — left thumb cluster
- `POS_RH_T1/T2/T3` — right thumb cluster

Each board's `positions.dtsi` maps these names to its physical key numbers. See `docs/keyPositionMapping.md` for the full cross-board reference table.

## Building firmware

### Automatic (recommended)

Push or merge to `main`. GitHub Actions validates the config, then builds all three keyboards in parallel. Firmware files are uploaded as artifacts on the [Actions](../../actions) page; retention follows the repository's artifact retention setting (currently 7 days).

### Manual — Go60 or Glove80 (Nix)

Requires Nix with the `moergo-glove80-zmk-dev` Cachix cache for fast builds.

```sh
# Clone the moergo ZMK fork alongside this repo
git clone https://github.com/moergo-sc/zmk src

# Build Go60
nix-build build/go60.nix --arg firmware 'import ./src {}' -o result-go60
# Output: result-go60/go60.uf2

# Build Glove80
nix-build build/glove80.nix --arg firmware 'import ./src {}' -o result-glove80
# Output: result-glove80/glove80.uf2
```

### Manual — SliceMK (west)

Run from the repo root:

```sh
west init -l config
west update --fetch-opt=--filter=tree:0
west zephyr-export
west build -s zmk/app -d .local-build/slicemk \
	-b slicemk_ergodox_202207_green_left -- \
	-DZMK_CONFIG="$PWD/config" \
	-DSHIELD="slicemk_ergodox_leftcentral"
# Output: .local-build/slicemk/zephyr/zmk.uf2
```

This matches the CI build flow in `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

---

## Output files

| Board | Artifact name | File |
|---|---|---|
| Go60 | `go60-firmware` | `go60.uf2` — flash left half, then right half |
| Glove80 | `glove80-firmware` | `glove80.uf2` — flash left half, then right half |
| SliceMK | `slicemk-firmware` | `zmk.uf2` — flash the left-central half |

## Making keymap changes

### The sync model — go60 is source of truth

Edit layers in `boards/go60/layers/`, then run:

```sh
./scripts/keymapsync.sh
```

This reads the translation maps in `boards/translations/` and propagates every go60 binding to the matching position on glove80 and slicemk. Positions that only exist on the target board (glove80 function row, slicemk inner columns, extra thumb keys) are left untouched.

For SliceMK, synced references to `&magic` are intentionally rewritten to `&none` during sync. This prevents undefined label errors because SliceMK intentionally does not include `shared/magic.dtsi`.

After syncing, review the diffs and commit all three boards together.

> **Note:** `keymapsync.sh` requires bash 4+. On macOS the system bash is 3.2; the script auto-detects this and re-execs itself using the Homebrew bash at `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash` or `/usr/local/bin/bash`. Install with `brew install bash` if not already present.

### Editing a layer

Open the go60 layer file first:

```
boards/go60/layers/<layer_name>.dtsi
```

Each file contains a single ZMK layer node with a `bindings` list. The binding order matches the position numbers in `boards/go60/positions.dtsi`.

After editing go60, run `keymapsync.sh`, then manually edit any board-specific positions in `boards/glove80/layers/` or `boards/slicemk/layers/` as needed.

### Inspecting layers across boards

```sh
# Show stub/fill status table for all layers × boards
./scripts/diff_layers.sh

# Show go60 bindings for a layer (numbered by key position)
./scripts/diff_layers.sh base

# Show a specific board's layer
./scripts/diff_layers.sh base glove80

# Diff two boards for a layer
./scripts/diff_layers.sh base go60 glove80
```

### Adding a combo

Edit `shared/combos/combos_common.dtsi` (or `combos_fkeys.dtsi` for F-key combos). The files contain raw combo nodes — do **not** add a `/ { combos { ... }; };` wrapper; that wrapper lives in each board's keymap file.

Use the logical position names (`POS_LH_C2R3`, etc.) so the combo works on all boards that share the same finger mapping.

### Adding a behavior or macro

Edit the relevant shared file:

- New behavior → `shared/behaviors.dtsi`
- New macro → `shared/macros.dtsi`
- New mod-morph → `shared/modMorphs.dtsi`
- Timing change → `shared/global_timings.dtsi`

### Board-specific hardware config (Go60: trackpad, RGB, etc.)

Edit `boards/go60/board_meta.dtsi`. Glove80 and SliceMK stubs are in their respective `board_meta.dtsi` files.

### Adding or removing a layer

1. Add/remove the `#define LAYER_Name N` entry in `shared/layers.dtsi` (keep indices contiguous, 0-based).
2. Create/delete the corresponding `layers/<name>.dtsi` file in **each** board's `layers/` directory.
3. Add/remove the `#include "layers/<name>.dtsi"` line in **each** board's keymap file (inside the `/ { keymap { ... }; };` block).
4. Update expected layer counts in `scripts/validation.sh`.

### Validating the repo structure

```sh
./scripts/check.sh        # sync + drift + validation + fixture tests (mirrors CI)
# or just the structural validation on its own:
./scripts/validation.sh
```

`validation.sh` covers repo structure and DTS sanity checks including required files, layer counts, binding counts per board, combo wrapper placement, include ordering, duplicate DTS labels, cross-board layer/reference consistency, behavior schema constraints, undefined `&label` detection, and translation-map consistency (no duplicate/out-of-range indices, entries agree with `positions.dtsi` logical names, full shared-position coverage, reverse-map inverse check). It also runs automatically in CI as the first job before any firmware build, alongside the `tests/keymapsync_test.sh` sync-engine regression tests.

### SliceMK and Magic layer behavior

SliceMK must not include `shared/magic.dtsi` (RGB_STATUS is unsupported in the `slicemk/zmk` fork).

To keep shared layers in sync without breaking SliceMK:

- go60 remains source of truth and may use `&magic` in layer bindings.
- `scripts/keymapsync.sh` rewrites synced `&magic ...` bindings to `&none` only for SliceMK targets.
- `scripts/validation.sh` checks both constraints: no SliceMK magic includes, and no undefined `&magic` references.

---

## Translation maps

Maps live in `boards/translations/` as `src_idx dst_idx` pairs (one per line, `#` for comments):

```
# go60 key 0 (POS_LH_C6R1) → glove80 key 10 (same logical position)
0 10
1 11
...
54 69   # go60 POS_LH_T1 → glove80 POS_LH_T1
```

Each map covers the 60 positions that go60 and the target board share. To update a map, match logical position names between `boards/go60/positions.dtsi` and the target board's `positions.dtsi`.

To add a net-new keyboard layout or board, follow [getting-started.md#adding-a-new-keyboard-layout](getting-started.md#adding-a-new-keyboard-layout).

## SliceMK PCB revision

To verify your PCB revision, put the keyboard into bootloader mode and check `INFO_UF2.TXT` — the `Model` field shows the board name. Common revisions:

| Model field | board value in build.yaml |
|---|---|
| `slicemk_ergodox_202207_green_left` | `slicemk_ergodox_202207_green_left` (this repo) |
| `slicemk_ergodox_202109` | `slicemk_ergodox_202109` |
| `slicemk_ergodox_202108_green_left` | `slicemk_ergodox_202108_green_left` |
| `slicemk_ergodox_202104` | `slicemk_ergodox_202104` |

Update `build.yaml` and `config/slicemk_ergodox_leftcentral.conf` if your board differs.

## ZMK concepts

**Behaviors** are reusable actions (key presses, layer toggles, custom logic) assigned to keys, combos, or macros.

**Combos** activate when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously, triggering a behavior instead of each key's normal action.

**Tap Dances** let a single key perform different actions based on tap count or hold duration.

**Macros** are ordered sequences of actions (key presses, behaviors) that execute when triggered.

**Home Row Mods (HRM)** use hold-tap behaviors on home-row keys so each key sends a letter on tap and a modifier on hold. This repo uses bilateral positional HRM — the hold only fires when the opposite hand or a thumb key is pressed simultaneously.
