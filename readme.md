### Layers (19 total)

| # | Name | File |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Base | `layers/base.dtsi` |
| 1 | Typing | `layers/typing.dtsi` |
| 2 | Autoshift | `layers/autoshift.dtsi` |
| 3–6 | HRM Left (Pinky/Ring/Middy/Index) | `layers/hrm_left_*.dtsi` |
| 7–10 | HRM Right (Pinky/Ring/Middy/Index) | `layers/hrm_right_*.dtsi` |
| 11 | Cursor | `layers/cursor.dtsi` |
| 12 | Keypad | `layers/keypad.dtsi` |
| 13 | Symbol | `layers/symbol.dtsi` |
| 14–17 | Mouse / MouseSlow / MouseFast / MouseWarp | `layers/mouse*.dtsi` |
| 18 | Magic | `layers/magic.dtsi` |

> SliceMK excludes the Magic layer (RGB_STATUS is unsupported in the `slicemk/zmk` fork), so it has 18 active layers.

### Key position naming

Positions use logical names so combos and HRM behaviors compile correctly across all boards:

- `POS_LH_CxRx` — left hand, column x, row x (1-indexed)
- `POS_RH_CxRx` — right hand, column x, row x
- `POS_LH_T1/T2/T3` — left thumb cluster
- `POS_RH_T1/T2/T3` — right thumb cluster

Each board's `positions.dtsi` maps these names to its physical key numbers. See `docs/positionmapping.md` for the full cross-board reference table.

## Building firmware

### Automatic (recommended)

Push or merge to `main`. GitHub Actions validates the config, then builds all three keyboards in parallel. Firmware files are uploaded as artifacts on the [Actions](../../actions) page and kept for 90 days.

### Manual — Go60 or Glove80 (Nix)

Requires Nix with the `moergo-glove80-zmk-dev` Cachix cache for fast builds.

```sh
# Clone the moergo ZMK fork alongside this repo
git clone https://github.com/moergo-sc/zmk src

# Build Go60
nix-build build/go60.nix --arg firmware 'import ./src {}' -o result-go60
# Output: result-go60/go60.uf2

# Build Glove80
nix-build build/glove80.nix --arg firmware 'import ./src {}' -o result-glove80
# Output: result-glove80/glove80.uf2
```

### Manual — SliceMK (west)

SliceMK uses a standard west-based build. See the [slicemk/zmk](https://github.com/slicemk/zmk) repo for local build instructions, or trigger a build via the GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch` button.

## Output files

| Board | Artifact name | File |
|---|---|---|
| Go60 | `go60-firmware` | `go60.uf2` — flash left half, then right half |
| Glove80 | `glove80-firmware` | `glove80.uf2` — flash left half, then right half |
| SliceMK | `firmware` | `.uf2` file — flash the left-central half |

Download from the Actions run page → click the job → scroll to **Artifacts**.

## Making keymap changes

### The sync model — go60 is source of truth

Edit layers in `boards/go60/layers/`, then run:

```sh
./scripts/keymapsync.sh
```

This reads the translation maps in `boards/translations/` and propagates every go60 binding to the matching position on glove80 and slicemk. Positions that only exist on the target board (glove80 function row, slicemk inner columns, extra thumb keys) are left untouched.

After syncing, review the diffs and commit all three boards together.

### Editing a layer

Open the go60 layer file first:

```
boards/go60/layers/<layer_name>.dtsi
```

Each file contains a single ZMK layer node with a `bindings` list. The binding order matches the position numbers in `boards/go60/positions.dtsi`.

After editing go60, run `keymapsync.sh`, then manually edit any board-specific positions in `boards/glove80/layers/` or `boards/slicemk/layers/` as needed.

### Inspecting layers across boards

```sh
# Show stub/fill status table for all layers × boards
./scripts/diff_layers.sh

# Show go60 bindings for a layer (numbered by key position)
./scripts/diff_layers.sh base

# Show a specific board's layer
./scripts/diff_layers.sh base glove80

# Diff two boards for a layer
./scripts/diff_layers.sh base go60 glove80
```

### Adding a combo

Edit `shared/combos/combos_common.dtsi` (or `combos_fkeys.dtsi` for F-key combos). The files contain raw combo nodes — do **not** add a `/ { combos { ... }; };` wrapper; that wrapper lives in each board's keymap file.

Use the logical position names (`POS_LH_C2R3`, etc.) so the combo works on all boards that share the same finger mapping.

### Adding a behavior or macro

Edit the relevant shared file:

- New behavior → `shared/behaviors.dtsi`
- New macro → `shared/macros.dtsi`
- New mod-morph → `shared/modMorphs.dtsi`
- Timing change → `shared/global_timings.dtsi`

### Board-specific hardware config (Go60: trackpad, RGB, etc.)

Edit `boards/go60/board_meta.dtsi`. Glove80 and SliceMK stubs are in their respective `board_meta.dtsi` files.

### Adding or removing a layer

1. Add/remove the `#define LAYER_Name N` entry in `shared/layers.dtsi` (keep indices contiguous).
2. Create/delete the corresponding `layers/<name>.dtsi` file in **each** board's `layers/` directory.
3. Add/remove the `#include "layers/<name>.dtsi"` line in **each** board's keymap file (inside the `/ { keymap { ... }; };` block).

### Validating the repo structure

```sh
./scripts/validation.sh
```

Runs 18 structural checks: required files, layer counts, binding counts per board, combo wrapper placement, include ordering, duplicate DTS labels, undefined `&label` references, and more. Also runs automatically in CI as the first job before any firmware build.

## SliceMK PCB revision

To verify your PCB revision, put the keyboard into bootloader mode and check `INFO_UF2.TXT` — the `Model` field shows the board name. Common revisions:

| Model field | board value in build.yaml |
|---|---|
| `slicemk_ergodox_202207_green_left` | `slicemk_ergodox_202207_green_left` (this repo) |
| `slicemk_ergodox_202109` | `slicemk_ergodox_202109` |
| `slicemk_ergodox_202108_green_left` | `slicemk_ergodox_202108_green_left` |
| `slicemk_ergodox_202104` | `slicemk_ergodox_202104` |

Update `build.yaml` and `config/slicemk_ergodox_leftcentral.conf` if your board differs.

Behaviors are reusable actions or functions (like key presses, layer toggles, or custom logic) that can be assigned to keys or referenced in combos/macros. They define what happens when a key is activated.

Combos are triggers that activate when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously. Instead of each key’s normal action, a combo can execute a behavior, such as sending a special keycode or running a macro.

Tap Dances allow a single key to perform different actions based on how many times it’s tapped or held. For example, a key might send a letter on a single tap, a symbol on a double tap, or act as a modifier when held.

Macros are sequences of actions (like multiple key presses or behaviors) that execute in order when triggered. Macros can be referenced by keys, combos, or tap dances, and are useful for automating complex input patterns.

In summary: behaviors are the building blocks, combos are multi-key triggers, tap dances are single-key multi-action triggers, and macros are ordered action sequences. Each offers a different way to enhance keyboard functionality in ZMK.
